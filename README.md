This project leverages machine learning techniques to automatically predict the outcome of legal judgments based on historical case data. By analyzing past legal rulings, this system aims to assist legal professionals, such as lawyers and judges, in forecasting the likely outcomes of similar future cases.

Features

Case Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing case descriptions for machine learning models.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features (e.g., case facts, legal articles, judgments) for prediction.
Model Training: Train predictive models using historical case data.
Outcome Prediction: Predict the judgment (e.g., guilty/not guilty, plaintiff/defendant) based on input case details.
Performance Metrics: Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for legal prediction tasks.
